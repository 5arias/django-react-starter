# R3CSS React Starter App

R3CSS is a minimal starter React application focused on best practices using React 16, Redux 4, React Router 4, and CSS modules (with PostCSS). The configuration is based on a create-react-app ejection and modified as needed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

These are the things you need to install before you can build or run the application
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Installing

After cloning the repo run `yarn install` to install the application dependencies

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `yarn run lint`

Lints and JavaScript and JSON files using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).<br />
Linting also happens automatically via pre-commit git hooks
